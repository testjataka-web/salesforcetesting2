# MCP Consumer Support Test Matrix

This repo is a **fixture for validating Jataka MCP tools** at three consumer support levels. After linking the GitHub App and backfilling Brum, run each scenario in Cursor (or Slack/Jira integrations) and verify the expected MCP tool returns a grounded answer.

## Prerequisites

1. Install the Jataka GitHub App on this repo.
2. Link the installation to your curriculum (`POST /integrations/github/link-installation`).
3. Wait for backfill to ingest: `.cls`, `.trigger`, `.flow-meta.xml`, `.object-meta.xml`.
4. Re-run backfill or push to `main` after adding new metadata.

> **Note:** LWC files (`.js`, `.html`) are **not** ingested on GitHub backfill. UI questions in L1 rely on `brum_search` over Apex/trigger metadata only unless you extend ingestion.

## Support level definitions

| Level | Consumer need | Primary MCP tools | Complexity |
|-------|---------------|-------------------|------------|
| **L1** | Lookup — "what exists, where, what does it do?" | `brum_search`, `fetch_linked_metadata`, `fetch_project_rules` | Single artifact, factual |
| **L2** | Diagnose — "why is it failing / how does it behave?" | `brum_qa`, `brum_search` | Logic chain, root cause |
| **L3** | Change — "what breaks if I change X?" | `get_impact_analysis`, `fetch_linked_metadata` | Cross-component dependencies |

---

## L1 — Lookup scenarios

### Account fixtures

| # | Ask this | Expected MCP tool | Expected answer (ground truth) |
|---|----------|-------------------|--------------------------------|
| L1-1 | What does `QuickAccountController.createAccount` do? | `brum_search` or `fetch_linked_metadata` | Creates an Account with Name, Phone, and `AccountStatus__c = Pending`, then inserts. |
| L1-2 | Which Apex class is called from the `AccountBeforeInsert` trigger? | `brum_search` | `DemoAccountTriggerHandler.handleBeforeInsert` |
| L1-3 | What picklist values exist on `Account.AccountStatus__c`? | `fetch_linked_metadata` (`sub_component_type: fields`) | Pending (default), Active, Blocked |
| L1-4 | What validation rule exists on Account? | `fetch_linked_metadata` (`sub_component_type: validationRule`) | `Block_Test_Account_Names` — blocks names containing `BLOCKED` |
| L1-5 | What are the project coding standards? | `fetch_project_rules` | Returns org shadow rules / conventions from Brum |

### Knowledge translation fixtures (consumer support)

| # | Ask this | Expected MCP tool | Expected answer (ground truth) |
|---|----------|-------------------|--------------------------------|
| L1-K1 | I completed a Spanish translation draft of my English troubleshooting manual but **Publish is greyed out**. I have Knowledge Manager rights. How do I release the Spanish version? | `brum_search` or `brum_qa` | Knowledge isolates publishing per language channel/status. Check Translation Queue assignment → open **Draft Translations** list view → **Submit for Publication** or **Submit for Review** → if not in Spanish translation group, a queue member must authorize. See `KnowledgeTranslationPublishService`. |
| L1-K2 | Which class defines Knowledge translation publish eligibility rules? | `brum_search` | `KnowledgeTranslationPublishService` |
| L1-K3 | What list view should I use to find unpublished Spanish Knowledge drafts? | `brum_search` | **Draft Translations** (`LIST_VIEW_DRAFT_TRANSLATIONS` constant in `KnowledgeTranslationPublishService`) |
| L1-K4 | What picklist values exist on `Knowledge_Translation_Request__c.Translation_Status__c`? | `fetch_linked_metadata` (`sub_component_type: fields`) | Draft (default), In Translation Queue, Pending Review, Published |
| L1-K5 | Which flow assigns the Spanish Translation Group queue on draft saves? | `brum_search` | `KnowledgeTranslationSubmit` |

### Knowledge Case article fixtures (consumer support)

| # | Ask this | Expected MCP tool | Expected answer (ground truth) |
|---|----------|-------------------|--------------------------------|
| L1-KC1 | I found an internal Knowledge Article that explains the resolution. How do I attach it to the active Case so it is tracked in resolution metrics, and send its text content to the customer's email via the console? | `brum_search` or `brum_qa` | Attach via Knowledge/Articles component or **Case Articles** related list (CaseArticle → metrics). Open console **Email**, use **Insert Knowledge** / Share Article (or paste customer-visible body), then send. Internal-only articles cannot be emailed until customer-visible. See `KnowledgeCaseResolutionService`. |
| L1-KC2 | Which class defines Case article attachment and console email guidance? | `brum_search` | `KnowledgeCaseResolutionService` |
| L1-KC3 | What related list tracks Knowledge articles on a Case for resolution metrics? | `brum_search` | **Case Articles** (`RELATED_LIST_CASE_ARTICLES`) |

**Pass criteria:** Answer cites the correct class/field/ rule without hallucinating extra components.

## L2 — Diagnose scenarios

### Account fixtures

| # | Ask this | Expected MCP tool | Expected answer (ground truth) |
|---|----------|-------------------|--------------------------------|
| L2-1 | Why does `DemoAccountService.createDemoAccounts` fail? | `brum_qa` | Throws `IllegalArgumentException`: *Security Violation: Accounts cannot be named "Demo"* because every proposed name contains `"Demo"`. |
| L2-2 | What runs before an Account is inserted? | `brum_qa` | `AccountBeforeInsert` trigger → `DemoAccountTriggerHandler` → `AccountStatusService.applyDefaultStatus` + `markActiveWhenPhonePresent`. |
| L2-3 | Why would an Account named "ACME BLOCKED CORP" fail to save? | `brum_qa` | Validation rule `Block_Test_Account_Names` on Account (declarative), not Apex. |
| L2-4 | When does `AccountStatus__c` become Active? | `brum_qa` | (1) Before insert if Phone is populated (`AccountStatusService`), (2) After save via `AccountOnboarding` flow when Phone is not null. |
| L2-5 | How does `quickAccountWizard` create accounts? | `brum_search` | LWC calls `@AuraEnabled QuickAccountController.createAccount` — *note: LWC source may not be in graph unless ingested separately*. |

### Knowledge translation fixtures

| # | Ask this | Expected MCP tool | Expected answer (ground truth) |
|---|----------|-------------------|--------------------------------|
| L2-K1 | Why is Publish disabled even though I have Knowledge Manager rights on a Spanish draft? | `brum_qa` | Knowledge Manager ≠ Spanish queue member. Draft/In Queue status blocks direct publish; `evaluatePublishEligibility` returns `publishButtonEnabled = false` until Submit for Review and queue authorization. |
| L2-K2 | What happens when I call `submitForReview` on a Spanish draft? | `brum_qa` | Status → `Pending_Review`; `Assigned_Queue__c` defaults to **Spanish Translation Group** if blank. |
| L2-K3 | Why does `authorizePublication` throw for a Knowledge Manager? | `brum_qa` | `KnowledgeTranslationQueueHelper.isCurrentUserQueueMember('es')` is false — Spanish publish requires queue membership, not profile alone. |
| L2-K4 | What runs when a Spanish draft `Knowledge_Translation_Request__c` is saved? | `brum_qa` | `KnowledgeTranslationSubmit` flow sets `Assigned_Queue__c = Spanish Translation Group` when `Language_Code__c = es` and status is Draft. |

### Knowledge Case article fixtures

| # | Ask this | Expected MCP tool | Expected answer (ground truth) |
|---|----------|-------------------|--------------------------------|
| L2-KC1 | Why is the Knowledge article not available to insert into the customer email from the Case console? | `brum_qa` | Article channel is Internal App only (`BLOCK_INTERNAL_ONLY`), or article is not yet attached to the Case. `diagnoseEmailUnavailable` / `describeAttachAndEmailSteps` in `KnowledgeCaseResolutionService`. |
| L2-KC2 | What happens if I try to email an InternalApp Knowledge article to a customer? | `brum_qa` | `canEmailToCustomer = false`; recommended action is publish/share to a customer-visible channel first; Case attach for metrics is still allowed. |

### Case Entitlement Milestone fixtures

| # | Ask this | Expected MCP tool | Expected answer (ground truth) |
|---|----------|-------------------|--------------------------------|
| L2-CM1 | I am trying to resolve a case before the 1-hour critical response milestone expires. I added a case comment and changed the status to 'Waiting on Customer'. When I hit save, I get an error: 'Validation error on Case: Cannot modify case status because the underlying Entitlement Milestone is locked by an open system transaction.' How do I override this? | `brum_qa` | There is **no supported override**. The Case Status change is blocked because an Entitlement Milestone is locked by an open system transaction. Wait/retry after the platform transaction completes, verify Entitlement / Case Milestone state in Service Console, and escalate to a Salesforce admin only if the lock persists. Do **not** edit CaseMilestone rows directly. See `CaseMilestoneLockGuidance.diagnoseStatusChangeBlocked` (`overrideAllowed = false`, `BLOCK_NO_OVERRIDE`). |
| L2-CM2 | Which class encodes Case Entitlement Milestone lock recovery guidance? | `brum_search` | `CaseMilestoneLockGuidance` |
| L2-CM3 | What does `CaseMilestoneLockGuidance.diagnoseStatusChangeBlocked` recommend when the milestone lock error is present? | `brum_qa` | `overrideAllowed = false`; wait and retry; verify milestone/entitlement state; admin repair if lock persists; never force-unlock. |

**Pass criteria:** Identifies the correct layer (Apex vs validation rule vs flow) and the specific line/rule causing behavior. Does **not** invent an entitlement override.

## L3 — Impact / change scenarios

### Account fixtures

| # | Ask this | Expected MCP tool | Expected dependents (minimum) |
|---|----------|-------------------|-------------------------------|
| L3-1 | What depends on `AccountStatus__c`? | `get_impact_analysis` on `AccountStatus__c` | `AccountStatusService`, `AccountStatusReportController`, `QuickAccountController`, `AccountOnboarding` flow, `DemoAccountTriggerHandler` |
| L3-2 | Impact of changing `DemoAccountTriggerHandler` | `get_impact_analysis` on `DemoAccountTriggerHandler` | `AccountBeforeInsert` trigger, indirect Account insert paths |
| L3-3 | Impact of modifying `AccountOnboarding` flow | `get_impact_analysis` on `AccountOnboarding` | Accounts with Phone set; field `AccountStatus__c` |
| L3-4 | If I remove the Demo name check in `DemoAccountService`, what's affected? | `get_impact_analysis` + `brum_qa` | Only bulk demo seed path; no trigger/flow impact |
| L3-5 | Before editing `QuickAccountController`, what should I check? | `get_impact_analysis` + `fetch_project_rules` | LWC consumer, `AccountStatus__c` assignment, sharing model (`with sharing`) |

### Knowledge translation fixtures

| # | Ask this | Expected MCP tool | Expected dependents (minimum) |
|---|----------|-------------------|-------------------------------|
| L3-K1 | What depends on `KnowledgeTranslationPublishService`? | `get_impact_analysis` on `KnowledgeTranslationPublishService` | `KnowledgeTranslationPublishController`, `KnowledgeTranslationQueueHelper` |
| L3-K2 | Impact of changing `Translation_Status__c` on `Knowledge_Translation_Request__c` | `get_impact_analysis` on `Translation_Status__c` | `KnowledgeTranslationPublishService`, `KnowledgeTranslationSubmit` flow |
| L3-K3 | Impact of modifying `KnowledgeTranslationSubmit` flow | `get_impact_analysis` on `KnowledgeTranslationSubmit` | Spanish draft records; `Assigned_Queue__c` assignment path |
| L3-K4 | Before editing Spanish queue logic, what should I check? | `get_impact_analysis` + `brum_qa` | `KnowledgeTranslationQueueHelper`, `authorizePublication`, `KnowledgeTranslationPublishController.publishAfterQueueApproval` |

### Knowledge Case article fixtures

| # | Ask this | Expected MCP tool | Expected dependents (minimum) |
|---|----------|-------------------|-------------------------------|
| L3-KC1 | What depends on `KnowledgeCaseResolutionService`? | `get_impact_analysis` on `KnowledgeCaseResolutionService` | `KnowledgeCaseResolutionController` |
| L3-KC2 | Before changing Case article email visibility rules, what should I check? | `get_impact_analysis` + `brum_qa` | `KnowledgeCaseResolutionController`, `diagnoseEmailUnavailable`, `BLOCK_INTERNAL_ONLY` |

**Pass criteria:** Lists real dependents from the knowledge graph; does not proceed with code changes when dependencies exist without a plan.

## L1 ticket CSV ↔ MCP scenario cross-links

Golden helpdesk tickets live in [`docs/tickets/`](tickets/) as Sales/Service CSV tables (loaded directly by the backend).
They are **eval fixtures** (not live Salesforce Cases). Notable tickets map to the MCP matrix above:

| Eval ticket | Cloud / area | Linked MCP scenarios | Repo artifacts |
|-------------|--------------|----------------------|----------------|
| `TSE-001` | Service / Knowledge Management | `L1-KC1`, `L1-KC2`, `L1-KC3` | `KnowledgeCaseResolutionService`, `KnowledgeCaseResolutionController` |
| `TSE-003` | Service / Knowledge Management | `L1-K1`, `L1-K2`, `L1-K3`, `L2-K1` | `KnowledgeTranslationPublishService`, `KnowledgeTranslationQueueHelper` |
| `TSE-009` | Service / Contracts & Entitlements | `L2-CM1`, `L2-CM2`, `L2-CM3` | `CaseMilestoneLockGuidance` |

**Suites** (CSV cloud filters only — no curated id decks):

| Suite id | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| `sales_l1` | All Sales Cloud L1 CSV rows |
| `service_l1` | All Service Cloud L1 CSV rows |
| `all_l1` | Full CSV corpus (default) |

Backend eval entry points (no Salesforce Case writeback):

- `GET /auto-resolution/ticket-eval/suites`
- `GET /auto-resolution/ticket-eval/tickets?suite=all_l1`
- `POST /auto-resolution/ticket-eval/tickets/:ticketId/run`
- `POST /auto-resolution/ticket-eval/suites/:suiteId/run`

Use end-user phrasing from the CSV problem column as variants of the MCP questions — same ground truth, richer natural language.

### Demo situations

Auto Resolution Demo lists tickets from the CSV suites (`all_l1` by default). The situation text is the ticket `issueText` / `subject`.

Org fixtures (optional live writeback) are seeded by `JatakaDemoFixtureService` / REST `/jataka/v1/demo-fixtures` when the Salesforce connector supports it for that ticket id.
Dashboard page: `/auto-resolution-demo`.

## How to run a test pass

1. Open Cursor with Jataka MCP connected to the curriculum that owns this repo.
2. For each row above, ask the question in a **fresh chat** (so `fetch_project_rules` runs cleanly).
3. Record: tool called, answer quality (pass/fail), latency.
4. After Apex edits, call `notify_code_change` with the actual changed body.

### Example Cursor prompts

```
L1: What picklist values are on Account.AccountStatus__c?
L2: Why does DemoAccountService.createDemoAccounts throw a security violation?
L3: Run impact analysis on AccountStatus__c before we rename it.

L1-K: Spanish Knowledge draft Publish is greyed out — I have Knowledge Manager rights. How do I release it?
L2-K: Why does authorizePublication fail for a Knowledge Manager on Spanish articles?
L3-K: Run impact analysis on KnowledgeTranslationPublishService before we change queue rules.

L1-KC: How do I attach a Knowledge article to a Case for metrics and email its content from the console?
L2-KC: Why can't I insert an internal Knowledge article into the customer email?
L3-KC: Run impact analysis on KnowledgeCaseResolutionService.

L2-CM: Case Status change to Waiting on Customer fails with Entitlement Milestone locked by an open system transaction — how do I override this?
```
